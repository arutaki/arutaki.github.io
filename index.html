      <p>I'm arutaki, I write here on data analysis, educations, modeling (the simulation kind),
        and mediocre artwork.</p>

      <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
      <p>I like to nerd about the most mundane social phenomenon around. Not much more complicated than your usual
        anime waifu tier list.
      </p>
      <h2>Educations</h2>
      <p>My first big boy job was to teach physics to engineering students. Not limited to physics, but also
        some lukewarm takes about education in general.
      </p>
      <h2>Modeling</h2>
      <p>I hope I did not spend 6 years in grad school for nothing. Similar to the data analysis section in concept.</p>
      <h2>Artwork</h2>
      <p>Just don't expect this to be good.</p>
