        <p>Hi, you can call me Al. I spent 6 years studying online echo chambers and political polarization in social media using agent-based modeling 
          at Tokyo Institute of Technology. During my time at graduate school, I used to work at PocketChange, Chowa Giken, and Pahamify.
          I also do some community organizing activities, including YES Project to provide clean water at rural Bali.
          I am still proud that I got to the final of Imagine Cup 2021, hopefully I can soon be proud with even more meaningful contributions somewhere that I don't need to put it here anymore.
          Before coming to Japan, I spent 6 years in Singapore where I studied and taught physics at Nanyang Technological University.
          Born and raised in Jakarta organically.
