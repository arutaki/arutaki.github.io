        <p>Hi, you can call me Al. I spent 6 years studying online echo chambers and political polarization in social media using agent-based modeling 
          at <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>. During my time at graduate school, I used to work at <a href="https://www.pocket-change.jp/en/">Pocket Change</a>, <a href="https://www.chowagiken.co.jp/top_en/">Chowa Giken</a>, and <a href="https://pahamify.com/">Pahamify</a>.
          I also do some community organizing activities, including <a href="https://www.yeh-sudamala.org/">YES Project</a> to provide clean water at rural Bali.
          I am still proud that I got to the final of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/student-developer-blog/meet-the-2021-imagine-cup-world-finalists/ba-p/2171758">Imagine Cup 2021 as Team Agent of Change</a>, hopefully I can soon be proud with even more meaningful contributions somewhere that I don't need to put it here anymore.
          Before coming to Japan, I spent 6 years in Singapore where I studied and taught physics at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/">Nanyang Technological University</a>.
          Born and raised in Jakarta organically.
