        <p>I can say with 100% confidence that Dota 2 is my favorite game ever. I spent more than 2000 hours playing the game 
            before I realized that not playing the game 8 hours nonstop do wonder to my perpetual back pain. Now that my primary 
            computer is a Mac, I somehow feel bad about abusing my keyboard that stops me from PC gaming altogether. Despite all 
            that, I still follow the pro scene religiously.

            Dota 2 is not the biggest esports around. But it is notable for the annual The International (TI) which boast itself
             as esports tournament with the largest prize pool. In 2021, they awarded $40,018,400 for 90 players in 18 competing 
             teams. If you look at the list of esports tournaments with highest prize pool, it is dominated by TI of various 
             years eclipsing Fortnite which is a much bigger game from the size of its player base.

            Even with such a large prize pool, many fans are concerned about the longevity of Dota 2 esports scene due to the
            players’ welfare. The nature of Dota 2 pro scene is a feast or famine one. The champion team earns around 45% of the 
            prize pool compare to that 13% earned by the runner up. For other teams who are at the bottom rank in the tournament, they 
            earn as low as 0.25% if they could not get pass through the group stage. It’s difficult to say whether the amount of money 
            is sufficient or not as Dota 2 pro players came from different part of the worlds with different living standards, but we 
            can all agree that there is such a different disparity even for those who compete at the most prestigious tournament in 
            the field.

            For the past 5 years, Valve as the developer and distributor of the game introduced Dota Pro Circuit (DPC).
            There have been two different systems of DPC, but essentially it is a way for teams to earn points and
            tournaments/leagues prize money throughout the year to gain DPC points. Teams that manage to acquire the most
            points in a year will get direct access to attend TI while others need to go for a lengthy qualifier to qualify.
            Teams that are more consistent throughout the year will generally have better chance to attend TI. Although this
            may vary due to the difference of region competitiveness and uneven DPC points awarded by achievements at the Majors 
            (and Minors for the first two DPC).

            Considering how significant doing well at TI is to the economy of the team, getting there in the first place is a
            top priority for most teams. Only the top team per region is guaranteed a place in TI through regional qualifiers. 
            There is also wild card in some year but of course teams would not want to rely on it to get to TI. Therefore, 
            it is pretty reasonable to assume that teams are trying their best to acquire DPC points as much as possible. But 
            remember, getting to TI alone is not enough. They also need to be the top teams there to reap the most benefit of 
            TI. It is natural to think that DPC points is a good proxy on how well a team would do at TI. After all, they have 
            been doing well for the whole year, why not now?
